# ToFindPill

**ToFindPill** is a cutting-edge mobile application designed to facilitate the quick and accurate recognition of drugs using advanced image processing and deep learning technologies. This application aims to help users, including healthcare professionals and patients, to identify drugs by simply capturing their image through a smartphone.

## Features

- **Image Capture and Upload:** Users can capture drug images directly using the smartphone camera or upload existing images from their gallery.
- **Image Quality Check:** Automatic verification ensures that the images meet the necessary quality standards for recognition.
- **Image Preprocessing:** Enhances image quality by correcting lighting, removing background noise, and resizing images for optimal processing.
- **Drug Feature Extraction:** Uses sophisticated algorithms to extract key features such as shape, color, and text from the drug images.
- **Real-Time Recognition:** Leverages a robust deep learning model to analyze images and provide real-time drug identification.
- **Database Integration:** Connects to an extensive drug database to fetch detailed information about the identified drugs.
- **User Interface:** Provides an intuitive interface displaying detailed drug information, including a confidence score that reflects the accuracy of the recognition.

## Technologies Used
